## Current Effects

Effects are split into different categories based on when they trigger. This package is relatively new so there aren't too many effects yet.

### Enters

Effects that trigger when the Txt object is first initialized

- typed sweep: characters type in as if written in a terminal
- randomized: characters appear in random order with an intermediate jumbled state
- number sweep: numbers shuffle and stabilize one by one

### Hovers

Effects that trigger when the Txt object is hovered over

- cursor sweep: a cursor character moves left to right through the text and idly flickers at the end
- twinkle: characters are randomly swapped out and put back at regular intervals
- shuffle: text between delimiter characters is randomly shuffled
